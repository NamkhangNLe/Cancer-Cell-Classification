# Cancer-Cell-Classification using Hough Transform

## Introduction
This Python program is designed to convert color photos of cancer cells into black and white images using the Hough Transform technique. Hough Transform is a widely used method in computer vision and image processing for detecting lines, curves, and shapes within an image. It achieves this by transforming the points in the image space into a parameter space, where shapes are represented in a parametric form.

## Hough Transform Overview
The fundamental concept behind Hough Transform is to treat each point in the image space as a potential part of a shape and then determine the parameters of the shape that the point belongs to. For example, when detecting lines, each point in the image space corresponds to a point on a line, and the parameters of the line can be expressed using attributes like slope and intercept.

To perform Hough Transform, a voting process is employed to accumulate the parameters of the shape for each point in the image space. In the case of detecting lines, for each image point, a set of lines is generated that pass through that point, and the parameters of these lines are registered as votes in the parameter space. The parameter space is usually represented as an accumulator array, where each element corresponds to a specific combination of parameters.

After completing the voting process, the elements in the accumulator array that receive the most votes represent the parameters of the shapes in the image space. In the context of detecting lines, the peaks in the accumulator array indicate the parameters of the lines within the image.

## Advantages and Considerations
Hough Transform offers several advantages:

1. **Robustness to Noise:** Hough Transform is robust to noise, which means it can effectively detect shapes even in noisy images.

2. **Handling Incomplete Shapes:** It can handle incomplete shapes within the image, making it valuable for detecting partially obscured or broken lines and curves.

However, it also has certain limitations and considerations:

1. **Computational Expense:** Hough Transform can be computationally expensive, particularly for large images or when detecting complex shapes.

2. **Parameter Sensitivity:** The accuracy of Hough Transform is sensitive to the choice of parameters. Fine-tuning may be necessary for different types of shapes and images.

## Usage
To use this program, follow the instructions provided in the code and ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You will need to input a color photo of cancer cells, and the program will generate a black and white version using the Hough Transform technique.
